I'm a **Software Developer** who currently works as a **Front-End Developer**, specializing in building pixel-perfect, responsive, and user-centric interfaces. With expertise in modern technologies, a strong eye for detail, and a passion for continuous improvement, I focus on delivering visually appealing and high-performance applications. ✨  

Apart from Engligh, I'm proficient in **JavaScript** and upskilling on Python 🛠️, I'm also skilled with frontend frameworks and libraries like **React**, **Next.js**, **EJS**, **jQuery**, and **TypeScript** ⚛️. For styling, I utilize tools like **Tailwind CSS** 🎨 and **SCSS/SASS** to ensure every application looks polished and professional. I have hands-on experience with **RESTful API integration**, **Redux** for state management, and authentication tools like **NextAuth** 🔐. Additionally, I’m experienced in testing frameworks like **Jest** and **Vitest** to deliver reliable and bug-free solutions ✅.  

On the backend, I’m familiar with technologies such as **Firebase** and **Django**, which I’ve used to create and integrate **RESTful APIs** ⚙️. My understanding of **web design principles** and **user experience (UX) design** helps me craft applications that are intuitive and easy to use.  

I’ve also engaged extensively in **version control** and **collaboration** using **Git** and **GitHub** 🗂️. I understand the importance of collaborative coding practices and have contributed to group projects where developers work together on shared codebases 🤝.
